//StringBuilder is a mutable sequence of characters, which means it can be modified after it's created, unlike String which is immutable.
//The reverse() method reverses the sequence of characters in the StringBuilder and returns the same StringBuilder object with the characters in reverse order.
//The toString() method converts the StringBuilder object back into a String.
//This is necessary because the lambda function needs to return a String, not a StringBuilder.
